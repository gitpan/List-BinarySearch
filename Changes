    - STATUS:
        - Stable release.  API may only break compatibility after a
          deprecation cycle.
    - API CHANGES:
        - bsearch_arrayref gets prototypes and becomes bsearch_str,
          and bsearch_num.
        - bsearch_transform_arrayref becomes bsearch_transform.
        - bsearch_custom is born.
        - bsearch_list is gone.
        - All functions now have prototypes to gain the familiar
          user-interface of List::Util and List::MoreUtils.
    - BUG FIXES:
        - A few POD typos fixed.
    - USER ENHANCEMENTS:
        - See API CHANGES.
        - Many POD changes to clarify text and simplify examples.
    - ADDITIONAL CODE ENHANCEMENTS:
        - Several logic paths were unrolled to eliminate costly subroutine
          calls inside of tight loops.
