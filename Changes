        - Stable.
    - API CHANGES:
        - Added bsearch_custom_pos function.

          most appropriate search function from the several choices.
        - Added bsearch_custom_pos.

            bsearch_num_range - Return a range.
            bsearch_general_range - Given a pair of targets returns a range
                                    of element indices between (inclusive).

        - bsearch_custom is born.
        - bsearch_list is gone.
        - All functions now have prototypes to gain the familiar
          user-interface of List::Util and List::MoreUtils.
    - BUG FIXES:
        - A few POD typos fixed.
    - USER ENHANCEMENTS:
        - See API CHANGES.
        - Many POD changes to clarify text and simplify examples.

          calls inside of tight loops.
