List::BinarySearch::XS is not installed.

This module will provide a performance improvement.  Though it is not required
for proper operation, it is strongly recommended that this module be installed
unless the target environment is unable to compile XS modules.

Answering 'yes' to the following question will cause most CPAN installers to
pull in the List::BinarySearch::XS module automatically.  If you are doing a
manual installation you will probably need to install List::BinarySearch::XS
separately.
